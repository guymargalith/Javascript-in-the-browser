        <h2 id="h2">Biography</h2>
        <p id="bio">Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (born February 16, 1990), known professionally as the Weeknd, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and record producer. Noted for his distinctive singing voice with a soaring falsetto and its singular tremolo, Tesfaye is considered an influential figure in contemporary popular music. He has received numerous accolades throughout his career, including three Grammy Awards, five American Music Awards, nineteen Billboard Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, fifteen Juno Awards, and an Academy Award nomination.</p>
        <h2>About the Album</h2>
        <p id="album">Thursday is the second mixtape by Canadian singer the Weeknd. It was originally released on August 18, 2011, by XO.
            Like his debut mixtape House of Balloons (2011), the Weeknd collaborated with producers and songwriters Doc McKinney and Illangelo; the duo produced Thursday in its entirety, and it contains fewer samples than its predecessor. Recorded in Toronto, the mixtape is also notable for its guest appearance from Canadian rapper, Drake.</p>
        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p id="reviews">Thursday received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the mixtape received an average score of 80, based on 17 reviews. Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club said, "It's a rare songwriter who can craft music that's so repellent yet also so irresistible."</p>
